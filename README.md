## The Project 
Our requirments for this build was as followed:

- You can use any server side or client side framework for your user interface 
- You can use any database for your project 
- Your app MUST be responsive (mobile compatible)
- You are NOT allowed to use Baas (Firebase, Realm, Backendless etc) 
- It would be great if your website has login/registration feature

## Concept
We went with a videogame database for the project given the requirements, to allow a build, 
that would use what we have learned with APIs, authentication and session, and building with PostgresSQL to this point.

## Current Build
-05/29/2020

At current, the website is deployed with operation.

as opposed to concept ideas pre-build, there is plenty missing that will be added.
